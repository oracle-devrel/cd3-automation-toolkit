The script createPEMKeys.py creates public/private key pair in PEM format required for Python APIs to communicate with OCI

The script createOCSWork.py accepts ocswork.properties as the input arguement.
The variables are defined in the properties file along with their description in comments

createOCSWork.py python script creates compartments for OCS related work, VMs and Network components. Further it creates VCN, subnet, route table and the VM
which will be used for OCS work. It also copies over the required files to the VM using Python SCP module. As part of cloud-init, a script is executed on
the VM.

The script will also setup the configuration to "cleanup" the work VM before you leave the customer.
Do not delete this configuration, unless you want to manually cleanup.

---------------------------------------------
Files copied to VM using createOCSWork.py python script:
---------------------------------------------
Python Config File - config
Private key File used for python APIs - oci_api_key.pem
Terraform files - provider.rf and variables.tf which will be used for Terraform to communicate to OCI
Git download expect script
Panda specific files - ftmcli.properties, ftmcli-v2.4.3.zip, panda.tf, upload panda expect script
Koala specific files - config file, run koala discover expect script
shell_script script file

---------------------------------------------------------
Files required for execution createOCSWork.py Python script:
----------------------------------------------------------
ocswork.properties - properties file; This would be accepted as arguement from the user
config             - Python config file to interact with OCI using API
cloud_init_script  - DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
                     This script which will be run as part of cloud init (ie on VM first instantiation)
                     This script checks if shell_script is copied over to the VM and if yes starts execution of the script.
shell_script       - DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
                     This is the script which configures the VM
                        -- Installs utilities like terraform, ansible
                        -- Installs required packages
                        -- Copying python config file to ~/.oci folder
                        -- Copying private key of the user to be used for python APIs
                        -- Downloads GIT repo
                        -- Accepts input from user in the properties file about whether to configure Koala and Panda also as part of initial setup.

----------------
Pre-Requisites
----------------
-- Python on your local system. PyCharm having oci, scp, paramiko, pycrypto,puttykeys modules installed.
   When you import the code if you see any other error regarding any package install that also
-- All above files mentioned with proper data
-- Set of public/private key pair in PEM format generated using openssl. Use createPEMKeys.py to generate public/private key pair in PEM format
-- Set of public/private key pair generated using puttygen which will be used to login to the VM



Note -
-- We are creating shell_script which will be copied to VM after all other files are copied and is executed as cloud-init once Python script finishes execution.
   This is to ensure that required files are first copied over to the VM and then only we should start the configure process to avoid any conflicts.
-- There are few sleep statements added in between the cmds so that execution happens properly and as required
-- Using Python 2.7 to compile the code as createPEMKeys.py rquires pycrypto module which did not get installed with Python3.7. Also to install this package,
   you might need to install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler. Download it from here: http://aka.ms/vcpython27
-- ocswork.properties is accepting 3 keys that can be pushed at a time to the VM. OCI VM accespts null or empty values if you dont want to pass 3 at a time.
   But Only the first key (ssh_key1) would be pushed to the Panda VM on OCIC. OCIC doesnt accept null values for keys.
