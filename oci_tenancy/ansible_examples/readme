## To create a list of servers - add them in /etc/ansible/hosts.  I've grouped a bunch of servers into [appservers]
## Also assigned a specific user for them - so it would use the opc user instead of the user we're running
## ansible-playbook as.

## /etc/ansible/hosts
[appservers]
10.41.16.2
10.41.16.3
10.41.16.4
10.41.16.5

[appservers:vars]
ansible_user=opc

## ALso in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg uncommented disable_host_checking
# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
host_key_checking = False

### Below is the command to run the yaml file against an individual server.

ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False; ansible-playbook -u opc --private-key $KEY_FILE_PATH -i $HOST_IP, update-ssh-keys.yaml

## To run for all servers
simply run ansible-playbook <playbook-name>.

## Everything that is defined in the yaml file under "hosts" would be picked up for the playbook.
