------------------------
Note- This version would require you to change your excel file and use the latest one since there is a column addition in the existing sheet.

1. Added support to add a common security List across subnets apart from just Default Security List. This is done by adding
    a new column in Subnets tab "common_seclist_name" which specifies name of common seclist to be created and used for each subnet.
    If left blank  for a particular subnet that means the common seclist doesnt not need to be assigned to that subnet.
2. Modified output files created for routes. Earlier tool used to create one TF file for all route tables. Now it would generate
    separate file for each Route Table like it does for Security List.
3. Introduced option to create new VCN under Update Network

    Please look in example folder for sample file.
3. Fixed issues related to Panda initialization via OCSWork VM, Added support to run OCSWork VM via Linux system.
4. Updated FSS creation code to include Multi FSS-1MT and 1FSS-multi MT
5. Updated modify_secrules_tf.py and modify_routerules_tf.py to process rows/vcns in the excel tabs which are part of cd3 only.

------------------------
SetUPOCI_Via_TF Tag v3.2
------------------------
1. Added Support for FSS via cd3 excel as well as csv. New sheet called 'FSS' has been added to the cd3. Please look
    in example folder for sample file.
2. Fixed minor issues related to egress rules in modify and export security lists. Specific egress rules could not be
    added earlier. Was allowing only egress all open.

------------------------
SetUPOCI_Via_TF Tag v3.1
------------------------
1. Added Support to enter names for VCN components- IGW, NGW, DRG and SGW. And also for route table and seclist attached to the subnets.
   This helps with customers who prefer to chose specific naming convention for all the components.
   How To Specify:
   -----------------
   a.) In VCNs Tab, under each column for the component like for drg_required, it accepts 3 values: y, n or component name.
   n means the component is not to be configured for the VCN, y means component would be configured with default name eg <vcn name>_DRG
   and if you specify some other text, the component will be configured with that text as the name of that component eg ashprodNGW in sample
   cd3 in example folder

   b.) For SecList Name and Route Table name, 2 columns have been created in Subnets Tab. If the column is left empty, default naming(same as subnet name) would
   be used for that route table or seclist name attached to that subnet. If you specify some name for seclist eg devqa_seclist then that many number of
   security lists as defined in VCNs tab would be created for the subnet with naming as eg devqa_seclist-1, devqa_seclist-2, devqa_seclist-3
   Also you can specify same route table name or seclist name for multiple subnets, it would attach same route table or seclists to those subnets.

2. Added Support for Dedicated VM Hosts.
   New sheet to specify Dedicated VM Host details has been introduced and a new column has been added in th Instances sheet if the instance needs to be launched
   in that dedicated VM Host

------------------------
SetUPOCI_Via_TF Tag v3.0
------------------------
New Features Added:
1. Added support for Network Security Groups. A new sheet has been introduced in cd3 which contains information about NSGs to be created
   and a new column added in Instances sheet which will define instance as part of NSG name.
2. setUpOCI.py script now accepts setUpOCI.properties which contains input params. So you can use this properties file to specify input param paths
   rather than giving at command prompt.

------------------------
SetUPOCI_Via_TF Tag v2.0
------------------------
New Features Added:
1. New Property is added in VCN-Info sheet which will accept regions that OCI tenancy is subscribed to. So Now the automation would
   work for any region rather than just Ashburn and Phoenix.
2. You can add a new subnet and DHCP option to the existing network. say eg after creating initial network, you have done customizations to the
   network or created few instances. So now if you want to add a new subnet or a new DHCP option (without altering existing network), a new option (no 14)
   has been introduced.
