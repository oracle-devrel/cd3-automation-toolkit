# Connect Docker container to OCI Tenancy


> ***Same container can be connected to multiple OCI tenancies. Repeat this process for every new OCI tenancy.***

### **Step 1 - Exec into the Container**:
* Run  ```docker ps```.
<br> → Note down the container ID from this cmd output.
* Run  ```docker exec -it <container_id> bash```
<br>Change Directory to 'user-scripts'
<br>```cd /cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/user-scripts/```

### **Step 2 - Create API PEM Key**:
RSA key pair in PEM format (minimum 2048 bits) is needed to use OCI APIs. If the key pair does not exist, create them using the below command:
<br>```python createAPIKey.py```
<br> → This will generate the public/private key pair (***_oci_api_public.pem_*** and ***_oci_api_private.pem_***) at **_/cd3user/tenancies/keys/_**
<br> → In case you already have the keys, you should copy the private key file inside the container and rename it to **_oci_api_private.pem_**.

### **Step 3 - Upload the Public key**:
Upload the Public key to **"APIkeys"** under user settings in OCI Console. Pre-requisite to use the complete functionality of the Automation Toolkit is to have the user as an administrator to the tenancy.
- Open the Console, and sign in as the user.
<br> View the details for the user who will be calling the API with the key pair.
- Open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and click User Settings.
- Click Add Public Key.</li><li>Paste the contents of the PEM public key in the dialog box and click Add.</li></ul>

### **Step 4 - Edit tenancyconfig.properties**:
Enter the details to **tenancyconfig.properties** file. Please make sure to review 'outdir_structure_file' parameter as per requirements. It is recommended to use seperate outdir structure in case the tenancy has large number of objects.
```
[Default]
# Mandatory Fields
# Friendly name for the Customer Tenancy eg: demotenancy;
# The generated .auto.tfvars will be prefixed with this customer name
customer_name=
tenancy_ocid=
fingerprint=
user_ocid=

# Path of API Private Key (PEM Key) File; If the PEM keys were generated by running createAPI.py, leave this field empty.
# Defaults to /cd3user/tenancies/keys/oci_api_private.pem when left empty.
key_path=

# Region ; defaults to us-ashburn-1 when left empty.
region=

# The outdir_structure_file defines the grouping of the terraform auto.tf.vars for the various generated resources.
# To have all the files generated in the corresponding region, leave this variable blank.
# To group resources into different directories within each region - specify the absolute path to the file.
# The default file is specified below. You can make changes to the grouping in the below file to suit your deployment"
outdir_structure_file=
#or
#outdir_structure_file=/cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/user-scripts/outdir_structure_file.properties

# Optional Fields
# SSH Key to launched instances
ssh_public_key=

```
### **Step 5 - Initialise the environment**:
Initialise your environment to use the Automation Toolkit.
<br>```python createTenancyConfig.py tenancyconfig.properties```

**Note** - If the API Keys were generated and added to the OCI console using previous steps, it might take a couple of seconds to reflect. Thus, running the above command immediately might result in Authentication Errors.<br>In such cases, please retry after a minute.

## Appendix
→ Files created on successful execution of above steps - Description of the Generated files:

| Files Generated | At File Path | Comment/Purpose |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Config File | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_config``` | Customer specific Config file is required for OCI API calls. |
| setUpOCI.properties | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties``` | Customer Specific properties files will be created. |
| outdir_structure_file | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_outdir_structure_file``` | Customer Specific properties file for outdir structure.<br> This file will not be generated if 'outdir_structure_file' parameter was set to empty(single outdir) in tenancyconfig.properties while running createTenancy.py |
| Region based directories | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files``` | Tenancy's subscribed regions based directories for the generation of terraform files.<br>Each region directory will contain individual directory for each service based on the parameter 'outdir_structure_file' |
| Variables File,Provider File, Root and Sub modules | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files/<region>``` | Required for terraform to work. |
| Public and Private Key Pair | Copied from ```/cd3user/tenancies/keys/```<br>to<br>```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/``` | API Keys that were previously generated are moved to customer specific out directory locations for easy access. |
| A log file with the commands to execute | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/cmds.log``` | This file contains a copy of the Commands to execute section of the console output. |
