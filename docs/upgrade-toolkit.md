# Steps to Upgrade Your Toolkit (For Existing Customers using older versions):

## Upgrade to Release v2024.3.0
1. Follow the steps in [Launch Docker Container](launch-container.md) to build new image with latest code and launch the container by specifying new path for <directory_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated> to create a fresh outdir.
2. Use export_resources(Non Greenfield) workflow to export the required OCI services into new excel sheet and the tfvars. Run terraform import commands also. Make sure to use [latest](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit/blob/main/cd3_automation_toolkit/example/CD3-Blank-template.xlsx) CD3 Blank Template for this release.
3. Once terraform is in synch, Switch to create_resources (Greenfield) workflow and use for any future modifications to the infra.


## Upgrade to Release v2024.2.2 from v2024.2.x

## Upgrade to Release v10.2 from v10.1
1. Follow the steps in [Launch Docker Container](launch-from-local.md) to build new image with latest code and launch the container by specifying same path for <directory_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated> to keep using same outdir.
2. There are minor upgrades to terraform modules. In order to use the latest modules, copy the contents(modules directory and all .tf files from _/cd3user/oci_tools/cd3\_automation\_toolkit/user-scripts/terraform_ <b>to</b> _/cd3user/tenancies/<customer\_name>/terraform\_files/<region\_dir>_. Move existing _variables\_\<region\>.tf_ to some backup and Copy OCI Connect Variables block from  this file into _variables\_example.tf_ file and rename it to  _variables\_\<region\>.tf_

## Upgrade to Release v10.1 from v10
1. Follow the steps in [Launch Docker Container](launch-from-local.md) to build new image with latest code and launch the container by specifying same path for <directory_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated> to keep using same outdir.
2. There are minor upgrades to terraform modules. In order to use the latest modules, copy the contents(modules directory and all .tf files except variables_example.tf) from _/cd3user/oci_tools/cd3\_automation\_toolkit/user-scripts/terraform_ <b>to</b> _/cd3user/tenancies/<customer\_name>/terraform\_files/<region\_dir>_.
3. Execute _terraform init -upgrade_ from outdir
4. If you had utilized 'Upload current terraform files/state to Resource Manager' option under 'Developer Services' to upload terraform stack to Resource Manager for v10, then you must copy existing 'rm_ocids.csv' file from _/cd3user/tenancies/<customer\_name>/terraform\_files/_ <b>to</b> _/cd3user/tenancies/<customer\_name>/terraform\_files/<region\_dir>_ before using this option again with v10.1.
5. Changes to the CD3 excel sheet templates include correction of the dropdowns for all tabs, few changes in Policies tab wrt policy statements. So users can keep using the v10 templates.
6. The new release supports a separate directory for each service. In order to use this feature for existing customers, execute createTenancy.py using a new outdir with  'outdir_structure_file' parameter set and then run export of the tenanncy into this new outdir using export_resources (Non Greenfield) workflow.

## Upgrade to Release v10 from v9.2.1
1. Follow the steps in [Launch Docker Container](launch-from-local.md) to build new image with latest code and launch the container by specifying same path for <directory_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated> to keep using same outdir.
2. Use new excel sheet templates to use OKE and SCH.
3. For existing services, user can continue using existing outdir.
