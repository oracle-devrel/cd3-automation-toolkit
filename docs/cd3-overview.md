CD3 stands for **Cloud Deployment Design Deliverable**. The CD3 Automation toolkit enables you to effortlessly Build, Export and Manage OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastruture) resources by converting Excel templates to fully functional Terraform modules within minutes ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è .

Additionally, the toolkit also supports seamless resource management using OCI DevOps GIT service and Jenkins Pipelines.

<br>
The toolkit supports 2 workflows:<br>

**1. Create & Manage Resources in OCI (Greenfield Workflow):**

- Use this workflow when there is empty OCI tenancy (or) need to create new resources without any requirement to modify / use any existing resources in tenancy.
- The filled in input Excel file is fed to the toolkit and terraform tfvars files are generated for all resources.
- Modifying the same excel sheet and re running the toolkit will generate modified terraform tfvars files.<br>
- The generated terraform files can be used to deploy resources in OCI by generating a terraform plan and approving the plan for apply. <br>

**2. Export & Manage Resources in OCI (Non-Greenfield Workflow):**

- Use this workflow when there is need to use / manage existing resources with terraform which have not been created using CD3. Export these existing resources into CD3 & TF State. Once the export is complete, switch to the create_resources (greenfield) workflow to create new or manage existing resources .
- The input Excel (preferably the Blank template) is fed to the toolkit and resources are exported into CD3 Excel template. <br>
- The toolkit then generates tfvars from the exported data in Excel file and also generates shell scripts with terraform import commands for all the resources.<br>
- The shell scripts have to be executed in order to have the updated state file to manage the resources further.<br>
- Modifying the same excel sheet and re running the toolkit will generate modified terraform tfvars files.<br>
