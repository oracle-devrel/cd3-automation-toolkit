**Why do you need CD3?**


⏳ For Enterprise infrastructures, manual resource provisioning is tedious and error-prone.

📝 Creating Terraform Code for each module/resource can be cumbersome and requires Terraform expertise.

🔁 Manually created infrastructure is hard to rebuild for different environments or regions.

**🎬 BTS: Here’s how it’s done!**


The toolkit transforms input data from Excel templates into Terraform files (auto.tfvars), enabling seamless creation of infrastructure in OCI.

**CD3 isn't just about creation!!!** ⬅️ Reverse engineer existing infrastructure back into Excel and IaC(terraform) and continue to manage your OCI resources using CD3 and IaC.
