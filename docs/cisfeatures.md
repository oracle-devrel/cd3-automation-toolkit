# CIS Compliance Features

These are additional features for **CIS Compliance** that are included in the setUpOCI Menu but are not listed in the CD3 Excel sheet.

#### **1. Run CIS compliance checker script**

The Automation Toolkit allows for running the CIS compliance checker script against your tenancy. It also facilitates downloading the latest script if necessary. A folder named ```<customer_name>_cis_report``` is created under ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/```, containing all the reports generated by the script.

As a best practice, the script should be executed after every deployment in the tenancy. The output report should be analyzed to minimize the reported anomalies according to the design requirements.


#### **2. Enable Cloud guard**

This will enable Cloud Guard for the tenancy from specified reporting region, clones the Oracle Managed detector and responder recipes. Creates a target for root compartment with the cloned recipes.

Below TF file is created:

| File name | Description|
|---|---|
