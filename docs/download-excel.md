# Download the CD3 Excel file

!!! Note
    The CD3 Excel file is available as an artifact for each build of the setUpOCI pipeline after successful completion of 'Execute setUpOCI' stage.

    For create_resources (Greenfield) workflow, this will be the same Excel file which was uploaded to create resources in OCI. 

    For export_resources (Non-Greenfield) workflow, this will be the updated Excel file with exported OCI resource data.

  Click on the **Build number** to the left corner of the setupoci pipeline as shown in below image. Under **Build Artifacts**, click on the Excel file name to download it.
