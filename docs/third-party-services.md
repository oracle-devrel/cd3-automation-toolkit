#### CIS compliance checker script

The Automation Toolkit allows for running the CIS compliance checker script against your tenancy. It also facilitates downloading the latest script if necessary. A folder named ```<customer_name>_cis_report``` is created under ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/```, containing all the reports generated by the script.

As a best practice, the script should be executed after every deployment in the tenancy. The output report should be analyzed to minimize the reported anomalies according to the design requirements.
