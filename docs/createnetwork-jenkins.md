### Create Network
Creation of Networking components using Automation Toolkit involves four simple steps.
 - Add the networking resource details to appropriate Excel Sheets.
 - Running the setUpOCI pipeline in the toolkit to generate auto.tfvars.
 - Executing terraform pipeline to provision the resources in OCI.
 - Exporting the automatically generated Security Rules and Route Rules by the toolkit to CD3 Excel Sheet.
 
Below are the steps to create Network that includes VCNs, Subnets, DHCP, DRG, Security List, Route Tables, DRG Route Tables, NSGs, etc.

1. Choose appropriate excel sheet from [Excel Templates](excel-templates.md) and fill the required Network details in the Networking Tabs - VCNs, DRGs, VCN Info, DHCP, Subnets, NSGs tabs.
   
2. Execute the _setupOCI_ pipeline with _Workflow_ as _Create Resources in OCI(Greenfield Workflow)_
   
3. Choose option _'Validate CD3'_ and then _'Validate Networks'_ to check for syntax errors in Excel sheet. Examine the log file generated at ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_cd3validator.log```. If there are errors, rectify them accordingly and proceed to the next step.

4. Choose _'Create Network'_ under _'Network'_ from the displayed options. Click on Build.

5. It will show different stages of execution of _setUpOCI_ pipeline and also launch the _terraform-apply_ pipeline for 'network'.
6. Click on Proceed for 'Get Approval' stage of the terraform pipeline.
       
   This completes the creation of Networking components in OCI. Verify the components in console. However the details of the default security lists and default route tables are not available in the CD3 Excel sheet yet. Inorder to export that data, follow the below steps:

7. Execute the _setupOCI.py_ pipeline with _Workflow_ as _Create Resources in OCI(Greenfield Workflow)_
8. Choose _'Network'_ from the displayed options. Choose below sub-options: (Make sure to choose all the three optionsfor the first time)
   - Security Rules
      - Export Security Rules (From OCI into SecRulesinOCI sheet)
   - Route Rules
      - Export Route Rules (From OCI into RouteRulesinOCI sheet)
   - DRG Route Rules
      - Export DRG Route Rules (From OCI into DRGRouteRulesinOCI sheet)
    Click on Build.

### Modify Network 
Modifying the Networking components using Automation Toolkit involves three simple steps.

 - Add/modify the details of networking components like the VCNs, Subnets, DHCP and DRG in Excel Sheet.
 - Running the the setUpOCI pipeline in the toolkit to generate auto.tfvars.
 - Executing Terraform pipeline to provision/modify the resources in OCI.

 ***Note***: Follow [these steps](#modify-security-rules-route-rules-and-drg-route-rules) to modify Security Rules, Route Rules and DRG Route Rules

<b>_Steps in detail_:</b>

1. Modify the excel sheet to update required data in the Tabs - VCNs, DRGs, VCN Info, DHCP and Subnets.
2. Execute the _setupOCI.py_ pipeline with _Workflow_ as _Create Resources in OCI(Greenfield Workflow)_
3. To Validate the CD3 excel Tabs - Choose option _'Validate CD3'_ and _'Validate Networks'_ from sub-menu to check for syntax errors in Excel sheet. Examine the log file generated at ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_cd3validator.logs```. If there are errors, rectify them accordingly and proceed to the next step.
4. Choose option to _'Modify Network'_ under _'Network'_ from the displayed options. Once the execution is successful, multiple .tfvars related to networking like ```<customer_name>_major-objects.auto.tfvars``` and more will be generated under the folder ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files/<region_dir>/<service_dir>```. Existing files will move into respective backup folders.   
 >**Note-**: Make sure to export Sec Rules, Route Rules, DRG Route Rules to CD3 Excel Sheet before executing this option.


5. It will show different stages of execution of _setUpOCI_ pipeline and also launch the _terraform-apply_ pipeline for 'network'.
6. Click on Proceed for 'Get Approval' stage of the terraform pipeline.
   
This completes the modification of Networking components in OCI. Verify the components in console.

This completes the modification of VLANs in OCI. Verify the components in console.

### RPCs

Remote VCN peering is the process of connecting two VCNs in different regions (but the same tenancy). The peering allows the VCNs' resources to communicate using private IP addresses without routing the traffic over the internet or through your on-premises network.
 
   - Modify the excel sheet to update required data in the Tabs - DRGs.
   - The source and target RPC details to be entered in DRG sheet for establishing a connection. Check the example in excel file for reference.
   - Make sure that the DRGRouteRulesinOCI sheet and corresponding to terraform is in synch with DRG route rules in OCI console. If not, follow the procedure specified in [Sync manual changes done in OCI of Security Rules, Route Rules and DRG Route Rules with CD3 Excel Sheet and Terraform](#sync-manual-changes-done-in-oci-of-security-rules-route-rules-and-drg-route-rules-with-cd3-excel-sheet-and-terraform)
   - Global directory which is inside the customer outdir will have all RPC related files and scripts.
   - The RPC resources(modules,provider configurations etc) are generated dynamically for the tenancy and can work along only with CD3 automation toolkit.
   - Choose option 'Network' and then 'Customer Connectivity' for creating RPC in create_resources (GreenField) workflow.
   - Output files are created under ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files/global/rpc directory```
