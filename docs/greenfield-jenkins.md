!!! info 
    This will copy the Excel file at `/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>` inside the container. It will also take backup of existing Excel on the container by appending the current datetime if same filename is uploaded in multiple executions.


**Step 4:** 
<br>Select the workflow as **Create New Resources in OCI(Greenfield Workflow)**. Choose single or multiple MainOptions as required and then corresponding SubOptions.
<br> Check out [this](multiple-services-jenkins.md) while selcting multiple options simultaneously.

Click on **Build** at the bottom.


**Step 5:** 
<br>setUpOCI pipeline is triggered and stages are executed as shown below.<br>
This will run the python script to generate the terraform auto.tfvars.  Once created, it will commit to the OCI Devops GIT Repo and then it will also launch terraform-apply pipelines for the services chosen (Stage:phoenix/identity and Stage:phoenix/tagging in the below screenshot).

## Execute terraform Pipelines
Terraform pipelines are auto triggered parallely from setUpOCI pipeline based on the services selected (the last two stages in above screenshot show trigger of terraform pipelines). <br>

**Step 1**: 

Click on 'Logs' for Stage: phoenix/identity and click on the pipeline link.

> ***Note - Navigating to Dashboard displays pipelines that are in running state at the bottom left corner.***<br>
> ***Or you can also navigate from Dashboard using the region based view (Dashboard -> phoenix View -> service specific pipeline)***<br>
<br>
> ***In this example it would be:*** <br>
> &emsp; ***terraform_files » phoenix » tagging » terraform-apply*** <br>
> &emsp; ***terraform_files » phoenix » identity » terraform-apply*** <br>

**Step 2**: 
<br>Stages of the terraform pipeline for apply are shown below:

**Step 3**:

**Step 4**: 
<br>'Get Approval' stage has timeout of 24 hours, if no action is taken the pipeline will be aborted after 24 hours. Click on this stage and click 'Proceed' to proceed with terraform apply or 'Abort' to cancel the terraform apply.
