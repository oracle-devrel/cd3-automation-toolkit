# **Other OCI Tools**

### CIS compliance checker script

The Automation toolkit provides an option to run the [CIS compliance checker script](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/blob/main/compliance-script.md) against your tenancy.

In the setupoci Greenfield menu, select **Other OCI Tools --> CIS Compliance Check Script**. Users can either choose to download the latest script or execute the script.  

A folder named ```<prefix>_cis_report``` is created under ```/cd3user/tenancies/<prefix>/othertools_files```, containing all the reports generated by the script.

As a best practice, the script should be executed after every deployment in the tenancy. The output report should be analyzed to minimize the reported anomalies according to the design requirements.

When using CLI, report can be copied to local system using -<br>
```scp -i <private_key> cd3user@<workVM IP>:/cd3user/mount_path/<prefix>/othertools_files/<prefix>_cis_report .```<br>
When using Jenkins, the report is available under Build Artifacts of the setUpOCI build

After successful execution, the report can be found under ```/cd3user/tenancies/<prefix>/othertools_files/<prefix>_showoci_report``` folder. 

When using CLI, report can be copied to local system using -<br>
```scp -i <private_key> cd3user@<workVM IP>:/cd3user/mount_path/<prefix>/othertools_files/<prefix>_showoci_report .```<br>

### OCI FSDR script

Now using CD3 you can export and update your DR plans using an excel spreadsheet.<br>
Export all your plans into separate tabs of the excel.<br>
Update your changes in excel itself and import that back to update in OCI.

<u>Common Use cases:</u>

- Clone user defined steps from one plan to another plan within the same region or across regions.
- Manage user defined steps in DR plans with Excel Spreadsheet.
- As of today if we update a member of an existing DR Protection group then the plan steps gets deleted(Product group is actively working to fix it) so we can export all the user-defined steps to excel and update it with the newly created DR plan when a member is updated.

<u>Features:</u>

- Easy to manage and update user defined steps.
- Plan stepâ€™s order is also maintained in the excel sheet. we can create steps in excel sheet in the same order we want it on the console.
- 1 Excel spreadsheet for maintaining all your DR switchover plans and Failover plans.

<u>IAM Policies to update DR plans in OCI:</u>

- Allow group <group-name> to manage dr-protection-groups in compartment <compartment-name>
- Allow group <group-name> to manage instances in compartment <compartment-name>
- Allow group <group-name> to read buckets in compartment <compartment-name>

1. In the setupoci Greenfield menu, select **Other OCI Tools --> OCI FSDR**.
