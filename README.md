## Why CD3?


‚è≥ For Enterprise infrastructures, manual resource provisioning is tedious and error-prone.

üìù Creating Terraform Code for each module/resource can be cumbersome and requires Terraform expertise.

üîÅ Manually created infrastructure is hard to rebuild for different environments or regions.

<br>

##  How CD3 works?


The toolkit transforms input data from Excel files into Terraform files, enabling seamless creation of infrastructure in OCI.

**CD3 isn't just about creation!!!** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Reverse engineer existing infrastructure back into Excel and IaC(terraform) and continue to manage your OCI resources using CD3.

üìú The generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or can be integrated into organization's existing DevOps CI/CD ecosystem.

<br>

## üë• Who can use the toolkit??

  Anyone who wants to create/modify new resources in OCI or export existing resources from OCI and manage IaC without much effort. 

<br>

## üí° Benefits of CD3:


   ‚úÖ Time saving ‚è∞ 
  
   ‚úÖ Faster infrastructure provisioning üöÄ
  
   ‚úÖ Scalability üìà
  
   ‚úÖ Operational efficiency ‚öôÔ∏è

<br>

   **There's more!!**

**Secure architecture üõ°Ô∏è:** CD3 toolkit helps customers deploy secure standardization across OCI tenancies by providing CIS-compliant Excel templates. It also enables native execution of the CIS Compliance Checker script against your tenancy.

**DevOps-oriented üîÑ:** The toolkit facilitates integration of consistent output Terraform files in module format with any continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution. The Terraform code can be reused to build similar workloads in different OCI regions and tenancies, which helps in quicker adoption of OCI.

**Platform independent üåê:** CD3 is packaged as a container that can be hosted on any platform.
